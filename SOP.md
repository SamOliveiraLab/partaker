In the microscope PC:

1. Save your files in your directory (with your name or nickname), that's available in the external hard drive (2-microscope images on the desktop)
2. For every experiment, create a NEW directory
	1. Format: experiment_date,
	2. ex: biofilm_ecoli_30_12_2024
	3. Put a README.md in the folder, explaining the cell line, the microscope parameters and experiment specificities
		1. E. colibiofilm experiment
		2. IPTG detergent
		3. PHC and mCherry fluorescence on channel 1
		4. Heat treatment after X hours
		5. Pictures every 5 minutes
3. Always remove the files or transfer to your external drive when experiments and analyses are done
4. Evaluate Experiments Using the ND2 Analyzer Tool:
	Biologists should use the tool directly on the microscope PC to:
		1. Evaluate ND files.
		2. Determine whether the experiment results meet their expectations.
		3. Once you like the results, connect to the MacStudio (server computer) for deeper analysis (Partaker, BiofilmQ, Orlando tools) with the support of the IT person.
		4. Connect to the MacStudio, Double-click the VNC software pinned to the taskbar and inside it, double click the MacStudio to connect.

In mac studio:

- The folders will be synced to the external hard drive, in the folder XXXX in the same format as organization as it is in the microscope PC.
- Keep All your analysis data, images and results from the tools (used on the server computer) organized within your folders.


Storage Maintenance:
	1.	Set each person directory limits:
		1. Each biologist has a defined quota of 200GB on the computers.
		2. Files exceeding the quota must be removed or transferred during maintenance periods.
		3. Always remove or transfer old files to personal External drive after completing experiments or analyses.

	2.	Scheduled Maintenance:
		1. There would be a regular maintenance on the HardDisks first of every month (or two) to clean up hard drives and ensure compliance with file organization standards and one week before the maintenance period, everyone will be notified to review their files and remove unnecessary data.
